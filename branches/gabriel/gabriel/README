The framework has 3 parts:

1.) ACL core framework for matching principals to permissions

2.) Components like AccessManager to integrate ACLs with applications and store and create ACLs

3.) Interceptors to protect method calls

3 depends on 2 depends on 1

Methods are mapped to permissions like
("POST_BLOG" -> Blog.post, Blog.store)

This way permissions like POST_BLOG can be used to protect method calls
and from within the GUI the permissions can be used to check 
wether to display a "POST" button.

Principals are mapped to permissions like
("Editor" -> "POST_BLOG", "REMOVE_POST")

Users are mapped to principals, but this is outside the scope of the
framework right now and might need another framework
like OSUSer to map principals to users and to authenticate
users.

Currently the application would map users to principals
somehow.
